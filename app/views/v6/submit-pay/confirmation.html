        We have sent a confirmation email to <strong>email@example.com</strong> which contains your reference number.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>We'll email you to let you know if the update statement has been accepted or rejected. We'll process the application as soon as possible. However, because this is a new service, we're not yet able to tell you exactly how long this will take.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do now</h2>
        <p>You must give the application reference number to the UK-regulated agent that completed verification checks. </p>

<p>The agent must then complete an <a href="/public/docs/Overseas-entity-verification-checks-statement.odt" class="govuk-link">Overseas entity verification checks statement</a> and email it to   agentcode@companieshouse.gov.uk.</p>

<p>They must do this <strong>within 14 days</strong>. We cannot process this update statement filing until we've received the statement.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>Once we have received the statement from the agent, we'll process the application as soon as possible. We'll email you to let you know if the update statement has been accepted or rejected. As this is a new service, we're not yet able to tell you exactly how long this will take.  </p>
