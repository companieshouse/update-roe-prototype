      <p class="govuk-body">An update statement must be filed every year by all overseas entities on the Register of Overseas Entities. 
      You must check and confirm that all the information on the register is still correct, and update anything that has changed. 
      You must file an update statement even if nothing has changed. </p>

      {# <p class="govuk-body">This will also apply retrospectively to overseas entities who bought property or land on or after:</p>

<!-- ******* When you need to file *******  -->
      <h3 id="background" class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to file </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">All overseas entities must file an update statement every year. You can file more often if you want to. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The date of your first update statement is one year from the date that the overseas entity was registered. If you file earlier, your next statement date will be one year after this. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You have 14 days from the statement date to file. After this, your filing will be considered late and you must file it as soon as possible. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">An update statement can only cover 12 months. If you need to cover more than 12 months, you’ll need to file another update statement.   </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can find the update statement date by searching for the entity on the  
      <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Companies House register</a>.</p>



<!-- ******* If nothing has changed  *******  -->
     <p class="govuk-body"><strong>If nothing has changed </strong>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must file an update statement even if there have not been any changes to the overseas entity during the update period. 
        This confirms that the information on the register is correct. </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When submitting an update statement, you will be asked to review all the information we show on the register about the overseas entity and its beneficial owners, managing officers and any related trusts (if relevant).
        You must update any information that has changed. </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">An authentication code is a unique 6 character code that every overseas entity needs in order to file online. 
        We'll ask for it every time someone files online for the entity — it confirms to us that they're authorised to do so.  </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To request an authentication code, search for the overseas entity on the

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Updating information on the register</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The overseas entity must file an annual update one year after it was registered, and every year after that. This will be used to tell us about any changes, or confirm that the information we hold is still correct. The update must be filed no later than 14 days after the due date. The entity can file earlier if it needs to update any information.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Removing an overseas entity</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">An overseas entity can apply to be removed from the Register of Overseas Entities if it does not own land or property in the UK.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The sections of The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 relating to updates and removal have not yet come into force. This means that updates and removal applications can only be made once this happens.</p> #}
