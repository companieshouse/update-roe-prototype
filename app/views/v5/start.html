        Use this service to check and update information about an overseas entity and its beneficial owners or managing officers. 
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">All overseas entities must file an overseas entity update statement at least once each year to confirm that the information on the Companies House register is up to date.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Verification checks</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">If there have been any changes to any of the overseas entity's beneficial owners or managing officers, these changes must be verified by a UK-regulated agent. This must be done no more than 3 months before this update statement is filed. The UK-regulated agent must have an <a href=#>agent assurance code</a> issued by Companies House.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>


      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to sign in to or create a Companies House account</li>
        <li>the Overseas Entity ID</li>
        <li>the overseas entity's authentication code</li>
        <li>the agent assurance code, if you're the UK-regulated agent that carried out the verification checks</li>
        <li>a credit or debit card to pay the £XX fee</li>

    If you need to request an authentication code, search for the overseas entity on the <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/">Companies House register</a>, and then select &#39;Request an authentication code&#39;. We’ll send the code to the email address we have on record for the overseas entity. </p>
