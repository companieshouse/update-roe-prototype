An overseas entity cannot apply to be removed if it: 

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>owns any property or land in the UK</li>
<li>still appears on any land registry as the registered owner of property or land in the UK</li>
</ul>

       <p class="govuk-body">
If you've already registered the disposal of property or land with the relevant land registry, you need to wait until it has been processed.</p>

<p>You can search the land registries online to check if the overseas entity is still listed on their records (they will charge a fee):</p>
