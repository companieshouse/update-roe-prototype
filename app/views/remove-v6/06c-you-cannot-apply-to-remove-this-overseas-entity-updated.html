What to do next</h2>

       <p class="govuk-body">
If you've already applied to register the disposal of property or land with the relevant land registry, you need to wait until it has been removed from their records.</p>

<p>You can search the land registries online to check if the overseas entity is still listed on their records (they will charge a fee):</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
       <li>
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry">HM Land Registry</a> (for England and Wales)
  </li>
      <li>
  <a href="https://www.ros.gov.uk/our-registers/land-register-of-scotland">Land Register of Scotland</a></li>
      <li>
  <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/searching-land-registry">Land Registry for Northern Ireland</a></li>
  </ul>

       <p class="govuk-body">
You may also need to <a href="#">file your overseas entity update statement</a> if it is due.
