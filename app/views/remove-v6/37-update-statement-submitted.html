      <p>
        We have sent a confirmation email to <strong>email@example.com</strong> which contains your reference number.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>We'll process the application as soon as possible. This includes checking with all the Land Registries that the overseas entity is not currently registered as the owner of any property or land in the UK. As this is a new service, we're not able to tell you exactly how long this will take.
        
      <p>Once we have processed the application, we'll email you to let you know if it has been accepted or rejected.</p>

      <p>If it is accepted, the overseas entity's status will change to 'De-registered'. Information about the entity and its beneficial owners will still be shown on the public register.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do now</h2>
        <p>You must give the application reference number to the UK-regulated agent that completed verification checks. </p>

<p>The agent must then complete an <a href="/public/docs/Overseas-entity-verification-checks-statement.odt" class="govuk-link">Overseas entity verification checks statement</a> and email it to   agentcode@companieshouse.gov.uk.</p>

<p>They must do this <strong>within 14 days</strong>. We cannot process this update statement filing until we've received the statement.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>Once we have received the statement from the agent, we'll process the application as soon as possible. We'll email you to let you know if the update statement has been accepted or rejected. As this is a new service, we're not yet able to tell you exactly how long this will take.  </p>
