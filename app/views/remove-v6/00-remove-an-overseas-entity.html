<!-- ******* What removing an overseas entity means *******  -->
      <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-top-0">
      <h3 id="what-de-register-means" class="govuk-heading-m">What removing an overseas entity means</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">If an overseas entity is not, or is no longer, a registered owner (proprietor) of land or property in the UK, it can apply to be removed from the Register of Overseas Entities.</p> 

      <p>This only applies to property or land in the UK that was bought on or after: 

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>1 January 1999 in England and Wales</li>
      <li>8 December 2014 in Scotland</li>
      <li>5 September 2022 in Northern Ireland</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">As part of the removal application, you must check and confirm that all the information we hold about the overseas entity is correct as at the date of the application. You will need to update anything that has changed.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">After an overseas entity has been removed</h3>


     <p class="govuk-body">Its Overseas Entity ID will no longer be valid. This means the entity will not be able to buy, sell, transfer, lease or charge its property or land in the UK, unless it re-registers.</p>

      

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "Information about the overseas entity and its beneficial owners will still be available to view on the public register."
}) }}



<!-- ******* When to apply *******  -->

      <h3 id="when-to-apply" class="govuk-heading-m">When to apply</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">After the overseas entity has disposed of all its UK property or land, you need to wait until the change of ownership has been updated on the relevant land registry records before you apply to Companies House for removal.</p> 

      <p class="govuk-body">You should only apply if the overseas entity is no longer listed on any land registry records as the registered owner (proprietor) of property or land in the UK. We will carry out checks with all UK land registries for every application we receive. </p>

{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "If our checks show that the entity is still listed as the registered owner of UK property or land, your application will be rejected and the fee will not be refunded."
}) }}

      <p class="govuk-body"> Before applying, we recommend carrying out your own searches online with the UK land registries (they will charge a fee):</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><a href="#">HM Land Registry (for England and Wales)</a> </li>
      <li><a href="#">Land Registry for Northern Ireland</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Land Register of Scotland</a></li>
    </ul>

<p class="govuk-body">For property or land registered in England and Wales, you may also be able to apply to HM Land Registry to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/searches-of-the-index-of-proprietors-names">search the index of proprietors' names</a>.</p>

<!-- ******* Who can use this service *******  -->
      <h3 id="who-can-use" class="govuk-heading-m">Who can use this service </h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can use this service if you work at, or work on behalf of, the overseas entity.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You also need to tell us about anyone that both became and ceased to be a registrable beneficial owner during the review period. The information you provide about them must be correct as at the date they stopped being one. </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to submit the application on paper, even if you do not need to make any changes to trust information. </p>

<!-- ******* How to get an authentication code *******  -->
      <h3 id="authentication" class="govuk-heading-m">How to get an authentication code</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">An authentication code is a unique 6 character code that every overseas entity needs in order to file online. We'll ask for it every time someone files online for the entity — it confirms to us that they're authorised to do so.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To request an authentication code, search for the overseas entity on the Companies House register, and then select 'Request an authentication code'.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We'll send the code to the email address we have on record for the overseas entity.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">They must be carried out by a UK-regulated agent no more than 3 months before the date of the removal application. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If nothing has changed and you're not updating any information, you do not need to complete any verification checks before applying to remove the overseas entity. </p>

<!-- ******* Agent assurance code *******  -->
      <h4 id="agent" class="govuk-heading-s">Agent assurance code</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">The UK-regulated agent carrying out verification checks must have an <a href="#">agent assurance code</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If they are also filing the removal application for the overseas entity, they will be asked to provide the code as part of this service.

      <p class="govuk-body">If the application is accepted, the overseas entity and its beneficial owners and managing officers will be added to the Register of Overseas Entities. </p>
       <p class="govuk-body">We'll also email the notice of registration to the overseas entity. This will include the Overseas Entity ID, which must be given to the Land Registry whenever the entity buys, sells or transfers land or property in the UK. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Updating information on the register</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The overseas entity must file an annual update one year after it was registered, and every year after that. This will be used to tell us about any changes, or confirm that the information we hold is still correct. The update must be filed no later than 14 days after the due date. The entity can file earlier if it needs to update any information.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Removing an overseas entity</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">An overseas entity can apply to be removed from the Register of Overseas Entities if it does not own land or property in the UK.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The sections of The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 relating to updates and removal have not yet come into force. This means that updates and removal applications can only be made once this happens.</p> #}
